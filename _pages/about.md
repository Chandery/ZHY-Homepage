## About Me

I am currently a lecturer in the School of Energy and Environmental Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing. I obtained my B.E and Ph.D degrees from USTB, under the supervision of Prof. Yanhui Feng and Prof. Lin Qiu. My research interests focus on heat transfer mechanisms in materials, include thermal simulation of nanoscale, thermal design of carbon materials and AI for materials.
